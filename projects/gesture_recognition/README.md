# Gesture Recognition

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Introduction

<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

In this project, we present a skeleton based pipeline for gesture recognition. The pipeline is three-stage. The first stage consists of a hand detection module that outputs bounding boxes of human hands from video frames. Afterwards, the second stage employs a pose estimation module to generate keypoints of the detected hands. Finally, the third stage utilizes a skeleton-based gesture recognition module to classify hand actions based on the provided hand skeleton. The three-stage pipeline is lightweight and can achieve real-time on CPU devices. In this README, we provide the models and the inference demo for the project. Training data preparation and training scripts are described in [TRAINING.md](/projects/hand_action/TRAINING.md). Deployment tools are described in [DEPLOYMENT.md](/projects/hand_action/DEPLOYMENT.md)
