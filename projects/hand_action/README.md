# Hand Action Recognition Project

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Introduction

<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

In this project, we present the development of a three-stage pipeline designed for the recognition of hand pose actions. The first stage incorporates a hand detection module, which outputs the bounding boxes of human hands from video frames. Following that, the second stage employs a pose estimation module to generate the key points of the detected hands. Lastly, the third stage utilizes a skeleton-based action recognition module to classify hand actions based on the provided hand skeletons. In this document, we provide the models and the inference demo for the project. Training data preparation and training scripts are described in [TRAINING.md](projects/hand_action/TRAINING.md). Deployment tools are described in [DEPLOYMENT.md](projects/hand_action/DEPLOYMENT.md)
